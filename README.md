## Front-end and connection to the back-end Challenge from Adri√°n Paniagua

---

This challenge has been solved using some upgrades on code.

Of course it mantaint the MERN stack version but working with:

- Material-ui (Popular React UI Framework) - To simplify the front-end layout.

- React-redux - An state container which permits access from anywhere in the app to states (bye bye childs and parents!)

- Redux-thunk - Perfect friend to use asyncronous actions between front and back-end.

- Moment - To use dates and times when an user post a new Todo in his lists. We will know how many time passes since it post it.

- React-hooks - To simplify the state writting of the components and changes.

## How and why?

---

I do that challenge in that way because the latests weeks I was learning and working on a similar project which includes these features such as material-ui, Redux and Hooks.

## What you can do

- See all the Todo's created.
- See the creator name.
- See the created time of the todo.
- Delete a Todo.
- Edit the todo (icon of 3 dots).
- Clear the form fields with a button.

## Buggs / Issues

- Sometimes (not every time) when editing I need to reload the page to see the changes.
- When deleting a todo, it deletes all todo's on the screen. But just aparently because when we reload the page we see the todo's that we dont delete before. :S
