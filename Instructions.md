**To run the application**

In the server folder (challenge-todo-api), run a new terminal (in the top tools, Terminal/New Terminal) and enter the command "npm run watch".

Then, in the app folder (challenge-todo-app), run a new terminal (same way than the server folder) and enter the command "npm start".

A new internet window will be open with the default browser of your computer with the app ready to use!
